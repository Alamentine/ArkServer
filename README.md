#######Important - about boss arenas and weight of creatures#######
- Weight is an important factor for checking if a creature is allowed to enter, so having creatures specifically with more weight is only useful for gathering / transport.

- element loot table for the bosses has been chanced for being a more rewarding experience

  - Brootmother(70-100/140-180/300-400)
